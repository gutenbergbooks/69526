Before the passage of the Act of 1866, by Congress, the ownership of
the mineral lands was retained by the nation. The first discussion of
the policy of selling such lands began in 1850, the argument being to
make them a source of revenue. The policy of leaving the mineral land
open for private exploration and development prevailed, and remained
the rule until 1866. The uncertainty of titles, etc., was urged in
1865-6, as reason for a change. Under legislation preceding that date,
no title could be or was conferred to mining claims, beyond possessory
rights, maintained by working and payment of a small royalty. Citizens
of the United States might explore and occupy under regulations as
prescribed by law. In the absence of congressional enactment, local
legislation was authorized to provide necessary rules; the local
customs and district rules not in conflict with the United States laws
were also recognized. The law was, in reality, a license only to go
upon the mineral-bearing portions of the public domain. Ownership,
however, attached to the minerals extracted, and the government had no
claim to them, except so far as royalty or license fees were concerned.


The Act of 1872

Is not compulsory upon miners. They are not obliged to procure a United
States patent for their claims. Those who do not, hold exactly the same
relations that they did before its passage, provided no adverse claim
is interposed. The Revised Statutes of the United States, Sections
2,318 to 2,352, of Title “Mineral Lands”; also, “Miscellaneous”
provisions ditto, embracing Sections 910, 2,238, 2,258, 2,386 and
2,406, provide that for


Quartz Mines

Any person who is a citizen of the United States, or who has declared
his intention to become a citizen, and no others, may locate and hold
a mining claim 1,500 linear feet along the course of any mineral
vein or lode subject to location; or any association of persons,
severally qualified as above, may make joint location of such claim of
1,500 feet; but in no event can a location of a vein or lode, made
subsequent to the date mentioned, exceed 1,500 feet along the course
thereof, whatever may be the number of persons in the company.

With regard to the extent of surface ground adjoining a lode or vein,
and claimed for the convenient working of the same, it is provided that
the lateral extent of location, made after May 10th, 1872, shall, in
no case, exceed 300 feet on each side of the middle of the vein at the
surface, and that no such surface rights shall be limited by any mining
regulations to less than 25 feet on each side of the middle of the vein
at the surface, except where adverse rights, existing on the 10th of
May, 1872, may render such limitations necessary; the end lines of such
claims to be in all cases parallel with each other.

By the foregoing it will be seen that no lode-claim, located after May
10th, 1872, can exceed a parallelogram 1,500 feet in length by 600 in
width, but whether surface ground of that width can be taken depends
upon the local regulations, or State or Territorial laws then in force
in the mining districts; but no such local regulations, or State or
Territorial laws, shall limit a vein or lode-claim to less than 1,500
feet along its course, nor can surface rights be limited to less than
50 feet in width, unless adverse claims, existing on May 10th, 1872,
render such lateral limitations necessary. It is provided by the
Revised Statutes that the miners of each district may make rules and
regulations not in conflict with the laws of the United States, or of
the State or Territory in which the districts are situated, governing
the location, manner of recording, and amount of work necessary to hold
possession of a claim.

In order to hold a possessory right to a location made prior to May
10th, 1872, not less than $100 worth of labor must be performed or
improvements made thereon, within one year from the date of such
location, and annually thereafter; in default of which the claim
will be subject to re-location by any one else having the necessary
qualifications, unless the original locator, his heirs, assigns, or
legal representatives, have resumed work after such failure and before
the re-location. The expenditures required upon mining claims may be
made from the surface, or in running a tunnel for the development of
such claims. The Act of February 11th, 1875, provided that where a
person or company has run a tunnel for the purpose of developing a lode
or lodes, the money so expended shall be considered as expended on the
said lode, and the owner or owners shall not be required to perform
work on the surface to hold the claim.

Individual proof of citizenship may be made by affidavit. If a company,
unincorporated, by the agent’s affidavit; if a corporation, by the
filing of a copy of charter or certificate of incorporation. Locators
against whom no adverse rights rested on the date of the Act of 1872,
shall have, on compliance with general law and recognized custom, the
exclusive right to


Possession and Enjoyment

Of the surface inclosure, and of “all veins, lodes, and ledges
which lie under the top or apex of such lines, extended downward
vertically,” even though they in their descent extend outside the
“side-lines of such surface locations.” The right to such outside parts
of veins or ledges is confined to all that lies between “vertical
planes drawn downward,” as described, so continued that these planes
“will intersect” the exterior parts of the said “veins or ledges.”
The surface of another’s claim cannot be entered by the locator or
possessor of such lode or vein.


What Constitutes a Deposit.

The word “deposit” has always been construed by the Land Office to be
a general term, embracing veins, lodes, ledges, placers, and all other
forms in which the valuable metals have ever been discovered. Whatever
is recognized as a mineral by standard authorities, where the same
is found in quality and quantity sufficient to render the land sought
to be patented more valuable on this account than for purposes of
agriculture, is treated by the Land Office as coming within the meaning
of the act. Lands, therefore, valuable on account of borax, carbonate
of soda, nitrate of soda, sulphur, alum, and asphalt, it is held may
be patented. The first section of the Act of 1872 says, “all valuable
mineral deposits.” The sixth section uses the term “valuable deposits.”
Deposits of fire-clay may be patented under the act, and so may iron
deposits, which may be patented as vein or placer claims. Lands, more
valuable on account of deposits of limestone, marble, kaoline, and mica
than for purposes of agriculture, may be patented as mineral lands.


Miners’ Form of Notice.

We hereby give notice that we have this ---- day of ---- A. D., 187-,
located this, the (“Centennial”) lode. We claim 1,500 feet in and along
the vein, linear and horizontal measurement.

We claim 1,200 feet along the vein, running in a northwesterly
course from the discovery shaft, and 300 feet running along the vein
southeasterly from the discovery shaft. We also claim 150 feet on each
side of the vein from center of crevice as surface ground.

The Act of 1872 provides that no lode-claim can be recorded until
after the discovery of a vein or lode within the limits of the ground
claimed. The claimant should, therefore, prior to recording his
claim, unless the vein can be traced on the surface, sink a shaft, or
run a tunnel or drift to a sufficient depth therein to discover and
develop a mineral-bearing vein, lode or crevice; should determine, if
possible, the general course of such vein in the direction from the
point of discovery, in which direction he will be governed in making
the boundary of his claim on the surface; and should give the course
and direction as nearly as practicable from the discovery shaft on the
claim to some permanent, well-known points or objects, such as, for
instance, stone monuments, blazed trees, the confluence of streams,
etc., which may be in the immediate vicinity, and which will serve to
perpetuate and fix the locus of the claim, and render it susceptible
of identification from the description thereof given in the record of
location in the district. He should drive a post, or erect a monument
of stones at each corner of his surface ground, and at the point of
discovery or discovery shaft, should fix a post, stake or board, upon
which should be designated the name of the lode, the name or names of
the locators, the number of feet claimed, and in what direction from
the point of discovery; it being essential that the location notice
filed for record, in addition to the foregoing description, should
state whether the entire claim of fifteen hundred feet is taken on one
side of the point of discovery, or whether it is partly upon the other
side thereof; and in the latter case, how many feet are claimed upon
each side of such discovery point. The following diagram of surface
boundaries, etc., of a lode, will aid the locator in this work:

Parties locating a lode are entitled to all the dips, spurs, angles,
variations, and ledges of the lode coming within the surface ground.

The disordered condition of Arizona consequent on the Civil War and the
continued hostilities of the Apaches, so impeded mining enterprises,
compelling the abandonment of valuable mines and preventing full
compliance with the conditions of the preceding acts, from no lack of
diligence or skill on the part of miners, that some legislation seemed
to be necessary to protect them from the injustice which a strict
enforcement of the law would necessitate. The following acts were
accordingly passed and approved on the dates specified.

An act approved March 1st, 1873, amends Section 5 of the Act of 1872,
above referred to, so as to read as follows: “That the time for the
annual expenditure on claims located prior to the passage of said act,
shall be extended to the 10th day of June, 1874.”

An act approved June 6th, 1874, made a further extension to January
1st, 1875.

An act approved February 11th 1875, so amends Section 2324, Revised
Statutes, as to provide that where “a person or company has or may run
a tunnel for the purpose of developing a lode or lodes owned by said
person or company, the money so expended on said tunnel shall be taken
and considered as expended on said lode or lodes, whether located prior
to or since the passage of said act; and such person or company shall
not be required to perform work on the surface of said lode or lodes in
order to hold the same, as required by said act.”


Recording Location.

Within a reasonable time, after the location shall have been marked on
the ground, notice thereof, accurately describing the claim in manner
aforesaid, should be filed for record with the proper recorder of the
district, who will thereupon issue the usual certificate of location.
The district regulations or customs are followed in this regard. Within
ninety days after location, a location certificate must be filed in the
office of the Recorder, in the county in which the lode is situated,
which should be in the following form:

  TERRITORY OF ARIZONA,    } ss.
       County of ----      }

Know all Men by these Presents, That ---- the undersigned, ha---- this
---- day of ---- A. D. 1877, located and claimed, and by these presents
do locate and claim, by right of discovery and location, in compliance
with the Mining Acts of Congress, approved May 19th, A. D. 1872, and
all subsequent Acts, and with the local customs, laws and regulations,
---- feet, linear and horizontal measurement, on the ---- Lode, along
the vein thereof, with all its dips, angles and variations, together
with ---- feet on each side of the middle of said vein at the surface;
and all veins, lodes, ledges and surface ground within the lines of
said claim ---- feet, running ---- from center of discovery shaft. Said
discovery shaft being situate upon said lode, and within the lines of
said claim in ---- Mining District, county of ---- and Territory of
Arizona, and further described as follows:

  Date of certificate, ------------   A. D. 1877.


Labor and Expenditures.

In order to hold the possessory rights to a claim of 1,500 feet of a
vein or lode located as aforesaid, the Act requires that until a patent
shall have been issued therefor, not less than $100 worth of labor on
the basis adopted by the local mining regulations shall be performed,
or improvements made thereon, during each year; in default of which
the claim will be subject to re-location by any other party having
the necessary qualifications, unless the original locator, his heirs,
assigns or legal representatives have resumed work thereon after such
failure and before such re-location. The importance of attending to
these details in the matter of location, labor and expenditure will be
the more readily perceived, when it is understood that a failure to
give the subject proper attention, may invalidate the claim.


Adverse Claims.

The seventh section of the United States laws provides for adverse
claims; fixes the time within which they shall be filed to have legal
effect, and prescribes the manner of their adjustment. An adverse
mining claim must be filed with the register of the same land office
with whom the application for patent was filed, or in his absence,
with the receiver, and within the sixty days’ period of newspaper
publication of notice. It must be duly sworn to by the party or parties
filing the adverse claim, and not by an attorney, before a officer
authorized to administer oaths within the land-district, or before
the register or receiver; fully set forth the nature and extent of
the interference or conflict; whether the adverse party claims as a
purchaser for valuable consideration, or as a locator; if the former,
the original conveyance, or a duly certified copy thereof, should be
furnished; or if the transaction was a mere verbal one he will narrate
the circumstances attending the purchase, the date thereof, and the
amount paid, which facts should be supported by the affidavit of one
or more witnesses, if any were present at the time; and if he claims
as a locator, he must file a duly certified copy of the location from
the office of the proper recorder. It will be incumbent upon the
adverse claimant to file a plat showing his claim, and its relative
situation or position with the one against which he claims, so that the
extent of the conflict may be the better understood. This plat must
be made from an actual survey by a United States deputy surveyor, who
will officially certify thereon to its correctness; and in addition
there must be attached to such plat of survey a certificate or sworn
statement by the surveyor, as to the approximate value of the labor
performed or improvements made upon the claim of the adverse party, and
the plat must indicate the position of any shafts, tunnels, or other
improvements, if any such exist upon the claim of the party opposing
the application. Upon the foregoing being filed within the sixty days
as aforesaid, the register, or in his absence, the receiver, will give
notice in writing to both parties to the contest that such adverse
claim has been filed, informing them that the party who filed the
adverse claim will be required within thirty days from the date of such
filing to commence proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction,
to determine the question of right of possession, and to prosecute the
same with reasonable diligence to final judgment; and that, should such
adverse claimant fail to do so, his adverse claim will be considered
waived, and the application for patent be allowed to proceed upon its
merits. When an adverse claim is filed as aforesaid, the register
or receiver will indorse upon the same the precise date of filing,
and preserve a record of the date of notifications issued thereon;
and thereafter all proceedings on the application for patent will be
suspended, with the exception of the completion of the publication and
posting of notices and plat, and the filing of the necessary proof
thereof, until the controversy shall have been adjudicated in court, or
the adverse claim waived or withdrawn.


Tunnels.

Tunnels run for the development of a vein or lode, or for the discovery
of mines, give the owner or owners the right of possession of all veins
or lodes within 3,000 feet from the face of the tunnel to the same
extent as if discovered from the surface, _i. e._, 1,500 feet on the
lode; and locations on the line of such tunnels of veins or lodes not
appearing on the surface, made by other parties after the commencement
of the tunnel, and while the same is being prosecuted with reasonable
diligence, shall be invalid; but failure to prosecute the work on
the tunnel for six months shall be considered an abandonment of the
right to all undiscovered veins or lodes on the line of said tunnel.
To avail themselves of the benefits of the law, the proprietors of a
mining tunnel will be required to give a proper notice of their tunnel
location, by erecting a substantial post, bound or monument at the
face or commencement thereof, upon which should be posted a good and
sufficient notice, giving the names of the party or parties claiming
the tunnel right, the actual or proposed course or direction, height
and width. At the time of posting notice and marking out the lines of
the tunnel, as aforesaid, a full and correct copy of such notice and
location must be filed for record with the mining recorder for the
district.


Placer Claims.

The laws of the United States provide, also, that no location of a
placer claim, made after July 9th, 1870, shall exceed 160 acres for any
one person or association of persons, which location shall conform to
the United States surveys. All placer claims located after May 10th,
1872, shall conform as nearly as practicable with the United States
system of public surveys, and no such location shall include more than
20 acres for each individual claimant.

These provisions of the law are construed by the commissioner of the
General Land Office, to mean that after the 9th of July, 1870, no
location of placer claim can be made to exceed 160 acres, whatever may
be the number of locators associated together, or whatever the local
regulations of the district may allow; and that from and after May
10th, 1872, no location made by an individual can exceed 20 acres,
and no location made by an association of individuals can exceed 160
acres; which location cannot be made by a less number than eight _bona
fide_ locators; but whether _as much_ as 20 acres can be located by an
individual, or 160 acres by an association, depends entirely upon the
mining regulations in force in the respective districts at the date
of the location; it being held that such mining regulations are in
no way enlarged by the statutes, but remain intact and in full force
with regard to the size of locations, in so far as they do not permit
locations in excess of the limits fixed by Congress; but that when
such regulations permit locations in excess of the maximum fixed by
Congress, they are restricted accordingly. A local regulation is valid,
therefore, which provides that a placer claim, for instance, shall
not exceed 100 feet square. Congress requires no annual expenditures
on placer claims, leaving them subject to the local laws, rules,
regulations and customs.


District Mining Regulations.

The following will serve as a model for the framing of district laws.
They will vary a little in detail, according to the requirements of the
locality.


Bounds and Laws of ---- District.

By virtue of a notice duly signed and posted, on ---- 1877, a meeting
of miners was held at place of posting notice on the ---- inst., at
which place and time the ---- Mining District was formed. Mr. ----
---- acted as Chairman, and ---- ---- acted as Secretary.

Following are the laws passed to govern the district:

1. The mining district shall be called the ---- Mining District.

2. The district shall embrace the following described and bounded
territory: commencing at the easterly end of the ---- ---- Mine, and
running west of north along the eastern boundary of the ---- Mining
District to the western end of the ---- Mine, in the ---- Mining
District, ---- ---- Mountains.

3. The County Recorder of ---- County, by virtue of his office, shall
be, ex-officio, recorder of this district.

4. Chapter six, of title thirty-two, revised statutes of the United
States, is adopted as this article.

5. In the location of mines in this district, copies of the notices of
location must be placed on the mines before any legal record of the
same can be made by the recorder. Any location not so made shall be
null and void.

6. All location notices must be filed in the office of the recorder
within thirty days after the actual date of location.

7. The County Recorder shall be entitled to a fee of two dollars for
each and every notice recorded by him.

8. The records of ---- County are hereby adopted as the bona fide
records of this district.

9. The annual meeting of the voters of this district shall take place
and be holden on the first Monday in May in each year.

10. Ten days prior to the date of holding the annual meeting, the
Recorder shall place, or cause to be placed or posted, in three of the
most conspicuous places in said district, a notice stating the time
when, and the place where, said meeting shall be holden, and shall
designate in such notice that the meeting shall be holden for the
purpose of transacting all and every kind of business which may be
properly brought before it.

11. At each annual meeting, the voters of the district shall elect
their chairman and secretary, who shall hold office for one year, or
until their successors are appointed.

12. The chairman and secretary of this meeting shall hold office from
the ---- day of ---- for one year, or until their successors are
elected.

13. The secretary of each meeting shall keep full and complete records
of the minutes and proceedings of their respective meetings, and cause
the same to be placed on record in the office of the County Recorder.

14. These rules, regulations and by-laws shall not be altered, or in
any way changed, except at a regular annual meeting of the miners of
said district, and then only by a legal vote of two-thirds of all the
voters present and voting.

15. Any and all persons who are citizens of the United States of
America, or who have declared their intention to become such, and own
shares of stock or interests in any mine in the district, or who has
worked in any mine in the district for the twenty days preceding such
meeting, shall be considered a legal voter, and entitled to vote at a
miners’ meeting.

16. Five dollars per day shall be allowed for each and every eight
hours’ work performed upon a mine for the purpose of holding title,
or performing the necessary amount of work for a patent, and no other
expenses shall be considered as expended for the purpose of holding or
perfecting title.

17. All mines hereafter located in this district shall be marked by
end and corner monuments or stakes, at least eighteen inches in height
above ground, with sufficient marks placed in or upon them to show
which end or corner of the claim they designate; if stakes are used,
they must be sunk at least six inches in the ground, and have a blaze
and figures upon one side.

18. All locations made and recorded previous to the adoption of these
rules, regulations and by-laws are hereby legalized, so far as they may
not conflict with the same.

19. These rules, regulations and by-laws shall be filed and recorded in
the office of the County Recorder of ---- County, and shall be in full
force and effect from and after this ---- day of ---- 1877.

20. The above proceedings, and the proceedings of any subsequent
meeting, shall be signed by the chairman and secretary, and transmitted
by them to the County Recorder without delay.

Water Rights.

The United States Revised Statutes provide:

1. That as a condition of sale in absence of legislation by Congress,
the legislature of a State or Territory may provide rules for working
mines, involving easements, drainage, and other necessary conditions;
these to be expressed in the patent.

2. That all prior rights, arising from possession, in the use of water,
and recognized by local laws, etc., or judicial decisions, shall be
regarded as vested, and shall be protected. This right of way is also
granted and confirmed. Damages are to accrue if a land-settler’s rights
are interfered with.

3. All land patents shall be subject to vested and accrued water
rights, including ditches and reservoirs.

Officers of United States Land Offices are required to file with the
General Land Office, the local laws on such matters. The following is a
summary of those passed by the legislature of Arizona.


Water Rights in the Territory.--All rivers, creeks, and streams
of running water in the Territory of Arizona are deemed public,
and applicable to the purposes of irrigation and mining. All the
inhabitants of the Territory who own or possess arable or irrigable
lands shall have the right to construct public or private acequias,
and obtain the necessary water for the same from any convenient river,
creek, or stream of running water.

All damages arising from construction of the acequias shall be assessed
by the Probate Judge of the county in a summary manner.

No inhabitant of the Territory shall have right to erect any dam or
build a mill, or place any machinery, or open any sluice, or make any
dyke, except such as are used for mining purposes, or the reduction of
metals, that may impede or obstruct irrigation.

When any ditch or acequia shall be taken out for agricultural purposes,
the person or persons so taking out such ditch or acequia shall have
the exclusive right to the water, or so much as may be necessary for
such purpose; and it at any time the water so required shall be taken
for mining purposes, the damages shall be assessed and paid.

All owners and proprietors of arable or irrigable land bordering on, or
irrigable by, any public acequia, shall labor on such public acequia,
whether such owners or proprietors cultivate the land or not; and all
persons interested in a public acequia, whether owners or lessees,
shall labor thereon in proportion to the amount of the land owned or
held by them, and which may be irrigated or subject to irrigation.

In all districts or precincts, the owners or proprietors of land
irrigated by public acequias are annually called together by the
Justices of the Peace, to elect one or more overseers for the
acequias--and it is the duty of said overseers to superintend the
opening, excavations and repairs of said acequias; to apportion the
number of laborers furnished by the owners and proprietors; to regulate
them according to the quantity of land to be irrigated by each one
from said acequia; to distribute and apportion the water in proportion
to the quantity to which each one is entitled according to the land
cultivated by him; and in making such apportionment, he shall take into
consideration the nature of the seed sown or planted, the crops and
plants cultivated; and to conduct and carry on such distribution with
justice and impartiality.

If any owner or proprietor of land irrigated by such acequia shall
neglect or refuse to furnish the number of laborers required by the
overseer, he shall be fined, and all fines shall be applied to the
benefit of said acequia.

Water privileges are, since the United States Act of May 10th, 1872,
located in the same manner as mines, subject to local regulations, i. e.
by definitely locating the five acres by monuments, and recording with
the District or County Recorder. If the local rules and decisions of
the Courts make the privilege forfeitable for non-use, another party
may come in and claim the water right.

The Federal Courts have decided that the right of way to construct
flumes or ditches, over the public lands, is unquestioned. It has
also been decided that the miners’ right to water, within “reasonable
limits,” is not to be questioned. “It must be exercised,” however,
with due regard to the general condition and needs of a community, and
cannot vest as an individual monopoly.


Mill Sites.

Land non-mineral in character, and not contiguous to the vein or lode,
used by the locator and proprietor for mining or milling purposes, can
be included in any application for patent, to an extent not to exceed
five acres, and subject to examination and payment as fixed for the
superficies of the lode. The owner of a quartz mill or reduction, not
a mine owner in connection therewith, may also receive a mill-site
patent. Such sites are located under the mining act, and in compliance
with local law and customs as recognized. Such possessory rights give
title also to all growing timber thereon. There must in every case be
given satisfactory proof of the non-mineral character of the site, and
the improvements thereon must be equal to $500 in value. A mill passes
to a railroad, if located after a land grant inured to the road.


Homestead and Pre-emption.


Homesteads.--Every head of a family, widow, single man or woman of the
age of twenty-one years, who is a citizen of the United States, or who
has declared his or her intention of becoming so, can enter upon 80
acres of government land within the limits of a railroad grant, or 160
acres outside said limits; and after a continuous residence upon it
and cultivation for five years, an absolute title to the land will be
given by the United States government, at a total cost of about $9 on
80 acres, or $18 on 160 acres.


Soldier’s Homestead.--Any soldier or sailor who served during the
rebellion not less than 90 days, and was honorably discharged, can
homestead 160 acres, either within or outside of the limits of a land
grant, and his term of service will be deducted from the five years’
residence required upon the land; but in any event he must reside one
year upon it. Thus, if he served three years, he would have to reside
upon the land two years; and in the event of his having served four or
five years, one year’s residence would be necessary.

A soldier or sailor has the privilege of filing application for
homestead upon the land through an agent or attorney, and need not for
six months commence actual settlement upon it. Absence from a homestead
at any time, for more than six months, works a forfeiture of right to
the land.


Pre-emptions.--Any person qualified under the homestead laws can
pre-empt 160 acres of government land within the limits of a railroad
grant, and after an actual residence upon and cultivation of the same
for at least six months, can obtain title by payment of $2.50 per acre,
or, if outside the limits, $1.25 per acre. It is imperative, however,
that the person so pre-empting shall (with his family, if any) reside
upon the land. The cultivation of a few acres is sufficient. The same
person, after having complied with the requirements of the laws of
pre-emption, can homestead 80 acres within the railroad grant, or 160
acres outside the limits. In this way, a soldier or sailor can secure
320 acres within the limits; and it is open to the _world at large_ for
_any_ man to acquire his 240 acres.


An Additional Homestead.--In addition to the Homestead and Pre-emption
laws, a recent act has been passed, whereby every settler, as the
fruits of his industry, can obtain another freehold of 160 acres under
the following act:

An Act to amend an Act entitled “An Act to encourage the growth of
timber on western prairies.”

“Any person who is the head of a family, or who shall have arrived at
the age of twenty-one years, and is a citizen of the United States,
or who shall have filed his declaration of intention to become such,
who shall plant, protect and keep in a healthy, growing condition for
eight years, 40 acres of timber, the trees thereon not being more than
twelve feet apart each way, on any quarter section of any of the public
lands of the United States, or 20 acres on any legal subdivision of 80
acres, or 10 acres on any legal subdivision of 40 acres, or one-fourth
part of any fractional subdivision of land less than 40 acres, shall
be entitled to a patent for the whole of said quarter section, or of
such legal subdivision of 80 or 40 acres or fractional subdivision of
less than 40 acres, as the case may be, at the expiration of the said
eight years, on making proof of such fact by not less than two credible
witnesses.”


How To Pre-empt.--When you have selected the land you wish for
pre-emption or homesteading under whatever right, it is better to get
a land attorney or clerk in the nearest land office to make out the
necessary papers. This saves time, and the danger of mistakes.


The Latest Regulations.--Commissioner Williamson, of the General Land
Office, has issued a circular to all registers and receivers throughout
the country, containing instructions requisite to carry into effect two
Acts of Congress, approved on the 3rd of April, relative to homestead
entries. The first provides a new method of making the final proof
in homestead entries. It dispenses with the present necessity of
attendance at the district land office. The person desiring to avail
himself thereof must appear with his witnesses before the judge of a
court of record of the county and State, or district and Territory in
which the land is situated, and there make the final proof required by
law according to the prescribed forms; which proof is required to be
transmitted by the judge or the clerk of the court, together with the
fee and charges allowed by law. The judge being absent in any case,
the proof may be made before the clerk of the proper court. The fact
of the absence of the judge must be certified in the papers by the
clerk acting in his place. If the land in any case is situated in an
unorganized county, the statute provides that the person may proceed
to make the proof in the manner indicated, in any adjacent county in
the State or Territory. The fact that the county in which the land
lies is unorganized, and that the county in which the proof is made
is adjacent thereto, must be certified by the officer. The other law
to which attention is invited by this circular is entitled “An Act
for the relief of settlers on the public lands under the pre-emption
laws.” Under this statute, a person desiring to change his claim under
a pre-emption filing to that of a homestead entry, should be required,
on making the change, to appear at the proper land office with his
witnesses, and show full compliance with the pre-emption law to the
date of such change, as has heretofore been required in transmutation
cases. Proof of such compliance must be forwarded with the entry
papers to this office. When the person applies to make final proof,
he must show continued residence and cultivation as required by the
homestead law. In case an adverse claim has attached to the land, due
notice in accordance with rules of practice must be given all persons
in interest, of time and place of submitting proof in support of the
application to make such change. The adverse claimants will be entitled
to the privilege of cross-questioning the applicants’ witnesses, and of
offering counter proof.

Lands formerly designated


As Mineral,

Can be entered by preëmption upon proof that mines or minerals are
not contained therein. Lands found, after entry as agricultural, to
contain valuable mineral deposits, such entry will be cancelled.
Where, however, a patent has issued, and the land has been afterwards
found to embrace a valuable deposit or lode, the title is valid, as
the land has ceased to be part of the public domain. Proof, however,
that the deposit, lode or mine was known before the patent issued
will invalidate title thereto. Titles to town sites and lots are held
subject, also, to mineral rights, which remain in the United States.

Under Act of 1876, it was permitted to any person, under the limit
of citizenship, or declaration of intent, to proceed upon the public
land, and occupy such area, to the extent of one section, or 640 acres,
which cannot be cultivated or used for agricultural purposes, with the
artificial conveying of water thereon and irrigation; three years being
given to construct the necessary works and improvements. The price of
such land is to be $1.25 per acre, one-fifth being required to be paid
at the time of location. In consequence of doubt as to the character
of land which this act was designed to embrace, and charges made of
fraudulent entries, further legislation will doubtless be had on this
subject.

Coal lands are allowed to be entered in legal subdivision parcels,
not to exceed 160 acres to any one person, or double that quantity
to an association; the price of the same to be $20 and $10 per acre,
according to whether or not the same be located within fifteen miles of
a completed railroad.

Rivers are deemed navigable only when they are used, or are susceptible
of being used, for commercial highways. The shores and soil under them
were reserved to the States respectively, and new States have the same
jurisdiction and sovereignty as old ones. The Land Office has never
permitted a complication of such rights by attempting or permitting the
sales of any portion of the beds of said rivers or streams.

Saline lands are not subject to homestead or preëmption entry. This
policy has been uniform since the beginning of our land system. The
Supreme Court has held uniformly that Congress has uniformly designed
to prevent the sale of saline deposits and springs. The existence of
such deposit or spring withdraws any quarter or other large portion of
a section from settlement and location.


United States Land Office Fees.

United States Land Office Registers and Receivers are permitted by law
to charge the following fees:

  Homestead or pre-emption declaratory statement                    $1.00
  On final certificate for each 160 acres                            5.00
       ”         ”           ”  320   ”                             10.00
       ”         ”           ”  section, or 640 acres               15.00
  Locations by States under grants, for each 160 acres               1.00
  For superintending public land sales                               5.00
  For acting on application for patent or adverse mineral claim      5.00
  For testimony either in mineral or agricultural land cases,
  taken in writing, for claimants, each 100 words                     .15

Under the laws of Arizona the County Recorders are authorized and
required to keep a record of all mines and mineral deposits that are
located. For this work they are entitled to receive for recording each
claim:

  Not to exceed one folio                                           $1.00
  For each additional folio                                           .20

It is also provided by act of territorial legislature, approved
November 9th, 1864, that persons in the military service of the United
States may locate mineral claims, all local or district regulations to
the contrary notwithstanding.

Under the Act of December 30th, 1865, in relation to placer mines and
mining, it is provided that in the county of Yuma, persons who in
locating placers shall place, for the purpose of mining thereon, a pump
or pumps with a capacity of 100 gallons per minute, may be entitled to
locate of placer land not to exceed 160 acres. This privilege is not to
include placer land which can be worked by water brought in ditches or
flumes.

Under Act of September 30th, 1867, it is provided that joint mining
claims may be segregated, when any of the owners thereof refuse or
fail to join in working them, after notices in the county or other
newspaper published nearest thereto, for the period of four weeks.
After such notice, the parties issuing may apply to the District Court;
notice is then posted conspicuously by the clerk, for requiring the
delinquents to appear within sixty days, and show why the prayer should
not be granted. At the end of this last period two commissioners may be
appointed, who choose a third; and they examine and report in writing.
A decree shall issue in accord with the report. Thirty days are allowed
for an appeal to the Supreme Court.

All grants of lands within the Territory, individual or corporate,
whether held under Mexican or United States titles, must be recorded in
the office of the County Recorder where situated. If not so entered,
they are declared null and void. It is provided also that settlers
shall be protected in the occupancy, use and improvement of 340 acres
of public lands.

Out of a ton of ore from the Stonewall Jackson Mine, adjoining the
General Lee, in the Globe District, (Arizona) there was extracted
October 25th, by the Pacific Refinery, San Francisco, ten bars of
silver valued at $3,800, which is over 36 per cent. metallic copper.

At Clinton, Arizona, the great copper mining center, the Longfellow
Company have two furnaces running, and turn out as high as 10,000
pounds of pig copper daily. The furnaces used are Bennett’s patent.
Arizona has, without doubt, the richest and most extensive copper mines
in the world. This metal is all shipped east by way of El Moro.

Charles P. Stanton, geologist, writes to the Prescott “Miner,” under
date of Nov. 9th, 1877, as follows: The great carboniferous basin of
Arizona--and in all probability of the world--exists within 140 miles
of Prescott. This immense coal deposit makes its first appearance
in Southwestern Colorado and Northwestern New Mexico; but its great
nucleus extends from Tierra Ausarilla, in Rio Arriba, New Mexico, to
the Colorado River, a distance of 276 miles, and from the San Juan
River, a distance of 138 miles. This immense area of 38,088 square
miles is one continuous mass of coal. It lies between the parallels of
100 and 112 west longitude, and 35 and 37 north latitude, and all in
Yavapai County.

Excellent Advice to the Emigrant Traveler

Is given by the California Immigrant Union, No. 248 Montgomery Street,
San Francisco, which, if heeded, will be of service:

1. Buy your tickets for passage on railroad or steamboat, only at the
office, before starting. Many of the runners who offer tickets for sale
in the streets are swindlers. If you intend to go in a steamer or ship,
examine the vessel before getting your ticket, and engage a particular
berth or room in a part of the vessel that is clean, well ventilated
and just comfortably warm.

2. Never show your money nor let any stranger know that you have any.
Thieves prefer to rob emigrants, who generally carry money with them,
and cannot stop to prosecute them, and have no acquaintances to aid in
the prosecution. Do not mention the fact that you are an emigrant to
persons who have no business to know it.

3. Never carry any large sum of money with you; you can always buy
drafts at banks, and if you are going to a strange place you can give
your photograph to the banker to forward to your destination, so that
you can be identified without trouble when you want to draw your money.

4. Avoid those strangers who claim to be old acquaintances, and whom
you do not recollect. A certain class of thieves claim the acquaintance
of ignorant countrymen whom they want to rob.

5. Do not drink at the solicitation of strangers; the first point of
the thief is to intoxicate or drug his victim.

6. Do not play cards for money with strangers; in many cases they
confederate to rob emigrants.

7. Travel in company with old friends, if possible, and do not leave
them. Thieves prefer to take their victims one at a time.

8. If you see anybody pick up a full pocket-book, and he offers it to
you for a small sum; or if you see some men playing cards, and you
are requested to bet on some point where it seems certain that you
must win; or it you see an auctioneer selling a fine gold watch for
five dollars, don’t let them catch you. Emigrants are systematically
swindled by such tricks.

9. If, when you arrive in a strange town, you want information and
advice, you can always get it by applying at the right place. First,
apply at the office of the Immigration Society, if there is one. If
you are a foreigner, you will probably find in the large cities a
Consular office or a benevolent society of your countrymen, and you can
apply there. Usually, there are attentive and polite men at the police
office. Public officers generally in the United States are ready to
assist and advise strangers.

10. Before starting from home, carefully read all the accessible books
about the State or Territory to which you intend to go; and when you
arrive, go to some place where you can find old friends, if you have
any. If you are poor, commence work immediately, but do not be in a
hurry to buy land, unless with the approval of men whom you can trust.
Take a month or two to get information about the country. Advice about
the purchase of land is often given with corrupt motives.

White Mountain Reservation.--The boundaries of the reservation to be as
follows, as shown in red on the accompanying map: Starting at the point
of intersection of the boundary between New Mexico and Arizona with the
south edge of the Black Mesa, and following the southern edge of the
Black Mesa to a point due north of Sombrero or Plumoso Butte; then due
south to said Sombrero or Plumoso Butte; then in the direction of the
Picache Colorado to the crest of the Apache Mountains, following said
crest down the Salt River to Pinal Creek, and then up the Pinal Creek
to the top of the Pinal Mountains; then following the crest of the
Pinal range, “the Cordilleras de la Gila,” the “Almagra Mountains,” and
other mountains bordering the north bank of the Gila River to the New
Mexican boundary, near Steeple Rock; then following said boundary north
to its intersection with the south edge of the Black Mesa, the starting
point.

By a rough trail from Fort Whipple over Granite Mountains to Ehle’s
Ranch (Skull Valley) the distance is estimated at eighteen miles. There
is another trail leading over this range entering Skull Valley at its
upper end, (Dickson’s Ranch) three and one-half miles from Ehle’s.
This trail is three or four miles longer than the other, but is not so
rough. In winter the short trail (so-called) is often obstructed by
snow. These trails are used by the “Mail Carrier.”

Irrigated lands in Southern Arizona will readily produce two crops
of grain each year, and several of alfalfa. Some lands, belonging
to the Pima Indians, as well as fields about Tucson and the ranches
of the Santa Cruz and San Pedro Valleys, are known to have been in
continuous cultivation for at least from two to three hundred years.
Water fertilizes and restores the soil. The valley of the Gila, under
analysis, shows more phosphorates and other fertilizers than that of
the Nile.

A sand storm on the mesas of Southern Arizona is not a pleasant affair
to encounter. If caught in one on horse-back or afoot, imitate the
animals, put your face close to the ground and turn your back to the
blast.

[1] The road runs along the bed of the stream for a part of the way;
when the river is high quicksands are troublesome, and the road is
sometimes impassable; whenever this is the case, the route is via the
Vulture Mine, by which the distance is increased 18 miles.

From Wickenburg to Prescott, via Walnut Grove, the distance, by a very
rough trail, is estimated at 55 miles. Ranch at Walnut Grove, half way.

From Wickenburg to Camp McDowell direct, by trail, the distance is
estimated at 65 miles.

[2] There is a road from this point down the Hassyampa to Burke’s
Station on the road between Fort Yuma and Maricopa Wells, with the
following Camps:--Gila Bend, 40 miles; Cottonwoods, 25 miles; Camp
opposite Oatman’s Flat, 10 miles; Agua Caliente, 16 miles; Burke’s
Station (fording Gila River), 5 miles--total, 96 miles. The road is
quite good, (though seldom traveled) and water, grass and wood are to
be found at all the above Camps.

From Date Creek to Maricopa Wells, the road is taken to Salinas Lower
Crossing (78 miles), thence by the Gila Lower Crossing (17 miles) to
Maricopa Wells (6 miles)--total, 102 miles. In winter, when the Salinas
and Gila are too high to ford, by going about 3 miles further up the
Gila to Morgan’s, advantage can be taken of a Ferry without increasing
the distance to Maricopa Wells.

From Camp McDowell to Prescott, by a proposed wagon road that is
opened from Prescott to Agua Frio, the distances are estimated as
follows:--Camp McDowell to Agua Frio, 47½ miles; Dickson’s Ranch, by
newly opened road, 23 miles; Agua Frio Ranch, by old road, 18 miles;
Prescott, 21 miles--total distance, 110 miles.

The road from Camp McDowell to Camp Reno has the following camping
grounds:--Camp Miller, 16 miles; Camp Carroll, 4½ miles; Camp
O’Connell, 4 miles; Camp Reno, 8½ miles--distance, 33 miles.

From Camp Reno to Camp Verde, by a newly opened road, it is to Camp in
Green Valley, 30 miles; thence to Camp Verde, by trail, 60 miles--total
distance, 90 miles.

[3] In rainy seasons, when the route by Agua Frio is impassable, it
is necessary to take the right fork to Salinas Lower Crossing, (22
miles) thence up the north bank of the Salinas to Phœnix (about 23
miles)--total, 45 miles,--increasing the distance from Camp Date Creek
to Camp McDowell about 16 miles.

At Prescott, clerks receive from $50 to $125 per month, with board
often thrown in; carpenters and painters, from $4 to $6 per day;
masons, from $6 to $8, and in some cases, when a man is possessed of
superior skill, as high as $10 per day; ranch hands, herders, cow-boys,
from $25 to $50 per month, and board; common laborers, from $2 to $3
per day; domestic servants, men and women, from $25 to $40 per month;
but as yet there is no great demand.

The road from Maricopa Wells to Pima Villages is cut up with small
gullies, from 1 to 4 feet deep, with steep sides, which, in rainy
seasons, are muddy and troublesome.

The left fork leads up the Gila to Adamsville, 2½ miles distant, where
are two stores, a mill, etc., and thence to Ruggles and Ewing’s Ranch,
(4 miles) where is a store; here the road intersects the road between
Camps McDowell and Grant.

Camp Grant to Camp Goodwin.--In very rainy seasons it is necessary to

in winter, is up the San Pedro River, 57 miles, to within 8 miles of
Tres Alamos, where the left fork leads to Croton Springs, distance 25
miles, and thence to Camp Goodwin, 71 miles--total distance, 153 miles.
On this road there are plenty of water, grass and wood, all along the
San Pedro River.

This is a stage station, with stores, etc., of importance. It is the
point of divergence for branch stages to Phœnix, Camp McDowell, and
Camp Verde.

Fuller, in his Treatise on Silver Mines, says: “Wherever, in any part
of the world, silver mines have been worked they are worked now, unless
closed for war, invasion of Indians, etc. We know of no silver mines
in the world that have given out.” In support of this position, he
instances the mines of Mexico, the old Spanish mines, (opened before
Humboldt’s time) the South American mines, still as productive as they
were three centuries ago, mines in Hungary worked before the Christian
era, the silver mines of Freiburg, opened in the 11th century, etc.,
nearly all now worked with unabated productiveness.

The Rio San Pedro is sometimes impassable in winter on account of high
water. The first nine miles of the road is in a cañon, level, and very
sandy; the rest of the road to Cañon del Oro is hilly, ascending till
near the cañon, when there is a long, steep descent. Three miles beyond
Cañon del Oro the road enters the bed of a stream, usually dry; and
continues in it to within a half mile of Dry Camp. At the foot of the
mountains, opposite Dry Camp, say one and a half miles distant, are the
ruins of an old Pueblo, where there is water all the year. The Roieta
in winter is a running stream.

[1] The road from Tucson is over a level mesa till it descends into a
cañon, where the Cienega begins. There are several steep hills in the
next few miles.

The banks of the San Pedro are high and steep, and about ten yards
apart.

[2] In winter it is necessary to take the right fork to avoid Eureka
Springs and the Cienega, just beyond it, which are then impassable.
This road joins the one by Eureka Springs about a mile beyond the
spring.

[3] In summer the creek is dry at this point, but water can always be
found by descending the creek half a mile.

The grasses in Arizona nearly all come up from the root, unlike those
of California, which grow from the seed. Therefore, in Arizona, if
there should be a year without rain, stock would not die of starvation.
The nutritious gramma grass does not appear to run to seed at all.

[1] The left fork crosses the Santa Cruz at Canoé, recrossing the

fork does not cross the river, and is longer.

[2] Just beyond Smith’s Ranch, take the left fork to Camp Crittenden.
The main road goes into Sonora.

Between Tubac and Smith’s Ranch, there are ranches every few miles,
with water, grass, and wood.

Between Sonoita and Camp Crittenden, there are several ranches with
water and grass, but little wood.

Road to Tubac very hard and smooth; but very rough from there to
Crittenden, through Sonoita Cañon.

[1] The Tank always contains water. The road from the Tank to the Gila
is over a grassy plain with no water in dry season, excepting at Water
Holes, near the Junction with the old road along the Rio de Sauz. There
water is usually found on the right-hand side of the road.

There is another road to Camp Goodwin, via San Simon, (seventeen and a
half miles) and thence down the Rio de Sauz, joining the above road at
Water Holes, (thirty-one miles) making the distance about eleven miles
longer.

Road from Virgin to Mountain Spring generally good.

From Moqui-Pueblos trail to Cascades and from Cosnino Tanks distances
were taken from map, and for road distances (though correction was
made) are probably too small.

The trail used from Cascades on Colorado Chiquito to wagon road is
perfectly practicable for wagon; hence good mail-road to Prescott.

Good camping ground at crossing of Muddy Cañon, between Fort Rock and
Oaks and Willows.

Road from Mineral Park good.

Road from Cerbat sandy.

Road from Beale’s Spring good; abandoned military post.

Road from Cottonwoods good. Mineral Park and Cerbat are both situated
about one mile east of road from Chloride City to Beale’s Spring.

To Navajo Springs, good made road round springs; excellent to Limestone
Pockets and beyond, till it passes divide, when it becomes sandy.

From Navajo Springs to Moqui-Pueblos trail, good road, following arroyo.

The famous Turquoise Mine is in New Mexico, near the Arizona line. It
comprises two enormous open quarries, perhaps 200 feet in depth at the
deepest point, and covering an area of several acres. They must have
been produced with great labor, since there are no traces anywhere of
the use of tools or gunpowder. Tradition refers these workings to a
period of greater antiquity than the Spanish occupation, and declares
them to have been executed by the Aztec inhabitants of the regions
who preceded the present Indian races. Stone hammers have been found
in these quarries, but no tools of any metal. The trachyte is seamed
and fissured throughout, at small intervals, and in every direction;
and there is no reason to doubt that hammers, wedges, and levers
would be quite sufficient to remove the solid masses. The turquoise
occurs fully in the fissures, in the form of narrow seams and plates,
rarely or never exceeding the fraction of an inch in thickness. The
majority of the seams now exposed show the impure green variety, which
is worthless. The Pueblo Indians, like civilized people, value the
light-blue turquoise only.

Stage arrives at Florence every morning at 7 A. M. from Tucson, and
leaves half an hour later for Yuma; stage from Yuma arrives every
evening at 6 P. M., and leaves for Tucson half an hour later. Stage
to Globe City leaves every Tuesday at 8 A. M., and arrives at 8 P. M.
Saturday. Phœnix and Prescott stages leave every other day at 7 A.
M., and arrive alternate days at 12 midnight. Stage for Silver King
leaves every Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 7 A. M., and arrives every
Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday at 4 P. M.

The military-geographical surveys, up to the fall of 1876, under Lieut.
Wheeler, in central and western Arizona, have covered a total area
of 17,954.6 square miles, or 11,490,944 acres. Of this total, it is
estimated that 25 per cent., or 4,488 square miles, being 2,875,238
acres, are fit for agricultural purposes, mostly requiring irrigation.
The timber is set down at 10 per cent., or 1,149,094 acres. For
grazing, the estimate is 30 per cent., and as barren, 35 per cent. The
total available land in the area surveyed is thus set down at 65 per
cent., being 11,670.6 square miles, or 7,469,114 acres.

The surveyors for the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fé Railroad have pressed
work beyond Cimarron, New Mexico, and expect to extend their surveys as
far as Tucson, Arizona, during the present winter. The building of the
road, however, will depend largely upon the corporation’s ability in
obtaining a land (or other) subsidy from Congress.

Among the secondary precious stones that have been found in Arizona
are black and green tourmalines, peridots, beautiful garnets of every
tint, bloodstone, jaspers and agate of every character, while fire and
white opals are found in certain localities. Zircona, in crystals,
very minute, of the cube form, and in masses, has been discovered.
Sufficient vein matter has not been found to determine any rich deposit
of fine crystals.

[1] Not on reservation, but in charge of agent.

[2] The Papago Agency has recently been consolidated with that of the
Pimas and Maricopas.

[3] The Southern Apaches, consisting of the Gila, Mogollon, Mumbre,
and Chiricahua Apaches, were removed from the Hot Springs Agency, in
New Mexico, to the San Carlos Agency, in May, 1877, by Agent Clum.

[4] The Navajo Agency is in both Arizona and New Mexico. The Navajoes
mostly live in New Mexico.


The total areas of above reservations are 9,560 square miles; tillable
acres, 46,000. Besides corn and wheat, 5,200 bushels of barley and
oats, and 3,456 bushels of vegetables were raised; 380 tons hay and 800
cords wood were cut. The Navajoes sold woolen materials, principally
blankets, to the amount of $20,000. The number of church
members recorded is 13.

Transcriber’s Notes

Added periods between the dollar and cents on the table on page xvii
and page xi.

The reprint that was used as the source for the ebook was flawed,
and two missing words were added to the notes on page l,
from an alternate document: “to the _amount of_ $20,000.”

Obvious typographical errors have been silently corrected. Variations
in hyphenation and accents have been standardised but all other
spelling and punctuation not mentioned here remains unchanged.

Italics are represented thus _italic_, bold is represented thus =bold=

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the
United States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that:

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
